# AntiGo
First, and above all: the LXQt desktop environment is nice, very nice. LXQt is written in C++, using the Qt graphical toolkit. It is a very complete, underestimated desktop!

I found the result phenomenal nice. "It's a beauty". 

Anyway, after using the FyneDesk desktop environment for a while, and especially after enjoying its simplicity in its codebase, the idea came up to 
replace the lxqt-panel application (which is at the heart of LXQt) by something else, a Go/Fyne solution. Fyne is a graphical toolkit written in Go. 

History reveals that LXQt is partly based on a project called "Antico".  The name of this project "AntiGo" was born rapidly.

My idea is too just replace "lxqt-panel", and create a drop-in "ntgo-panel" application. 

Ambitious? Sure. 

For now, development takes place in a private repository.
